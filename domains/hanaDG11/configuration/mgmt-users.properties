# for new AS 7.1 installations. Further authentication mechanism can be configured
# as part of the <management /> in standalone.xml.
#
# Users can be added to this properties file at any time, updates after the server has started
# will be automatically detected.

#
# A utility script is provided which can be executed from the bin folder to add the users: -
# - Linux
